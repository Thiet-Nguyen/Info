# Welcome Meow Coin Community
Meow Coin created by people who love Cats!

What is Meow Coin?
Meow Coin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that enables you to easily send money online. Think of it as "the internet currency."

What's With Meow And The Cat?
A meow is a vocalization of cats. They have diverse tones and are sometimes chattered, murmured or whispered. Adult cats rarely meow to each other, so an adult cat meowing to human beings is probably a post-domestication extension of meowing by kittens, a call for attention.

The fun and friendly internet currency.
Meow Coin sets itself apart from other digital currencies with an amazing, vibrant community made up of friendly folks just like you.
